This is an open-source backend skeleton designed from a real product perspective.

Instead of starting with features, it starts with how products actually work:
users, workspaces, permissions, content, and accountability.

Built with Go, Hertz, PostgreSQL, and Redis, it aims to be a practical foundation for serious products — not just demos.
